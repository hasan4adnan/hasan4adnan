# Hi, I'm hasan4adnan 👋

Software Engineer | AWS Solutions Architect | Mobile & Backend Developer | AI/ML

> I build scalable cloud architectures on AWS, high-performance mobile apps with React Native CLI, and backend systems with Node.js. Strong in Python and building applied AI/ML projects.

## 🔭 About Me
I design and ship production-ready systems for large-scale SaaS: cloud-native architectures on AWS, performant mobile experiences with React Native CLI, and robust backend services with Node.js. I pair pragmatic engineering with automation and observability to deliver reliable products at scale.

- Primary focus: Large-scale SaaS, Cloud Engineering, AI/ML
- Current work: building applied machine learning projects and end-to-end cloud platforms
- Strengths: system design, performance tuning, automation, and developer experience

## 🛠️ Tech & Tools
AWS • Terraform • React Native CLI • Node.js • React • Python • SQL • Docker  
CI/CD: GitHub Actions, CircleCI • Databases: PostgreSQL, Redis • Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana

---

## 🚀 Typical Projects I Build
- Scalable multi-tenant SaaS platforms with automated provisioning and observability
- High-performance mobile apps (React Native CLI) with native modules and optimized builds
- Backend systems and APIs (Node.js) with strong test coverage, caching, and horizontal scaling
- Applied AI/ML prototypes and pipelines using Python — model training, inference, and deployment on AWS

---

## 📈 Selected Highlights
- Architected and deployed production workloads on AWS with Terraform (IaC), autoscaling, and secure networking
- Built cross-platform mobile apps with React Native CLI focused on performance and native integrations
- Implemented backend systems in Node.js that emphasize reliability, monitoring, and cost-efficiency
- Actively developing ML projects that solve real user problems (data pipelines, model serving, and evaluation)

---

## 🧩 How I Work
- Design for operability: observability, alerting, and graceful failure modes
- Prefer iterative improvements with measurable outcomes
- Emphasize clear APIs, well-tested code, and automated deployments
- Collaborate closely with product and design to ship high-impact features
